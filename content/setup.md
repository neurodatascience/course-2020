## The short version

To get the most out of our course, we require that you arrive at the course with the following software already installed:

- A command-line shell: Bash
- A version control system: Git
- A remote-capable text editor: VSCode
- Python 3 (not Python 2!)
- A virtualization system: Docker
- A modern browser (e.g., a recent build of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

If you already have all of the above software tools/packages installed, or are confident youâ€™ll be able to install them by the time the course starts, you can probably stop reading here. The rest of this page provides more detail on installation procedures for each of the above elements, with separate instructions for each of the three major operating systems (Windows, OS X, and Linux).

## The long version

Coming soon! For now, please refer to these instructions from [Neurohackademy](https://neurohackademy.org/setup/).
